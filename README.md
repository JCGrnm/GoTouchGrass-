# 🌿 **GoTouchGrass()** 🌿

## Click here for the [Live Demo 🌱](https://jcgrnm.github.io/GoTouchGrass-/)


GoTouchGrass() is a fun little app that invites you to do one thing: go outside, snap a photo outside and find out if it’s grass or not! 

⚠️ Heads up! (FOR NOW) This app doesn't *really* know what grass looks like — it learns from whatever you teach it.  
So yes, if you call your face "grass" five times, it'll believe you. Use it as a silly excuse to step outside! 🌿😄

**Why GoTouchGrass()?**  
As devs, we spend a lot of time indoors.
GoTouchGrass() is a gentle reminder to literally go outside and touch some grass. 🌿

## 📱 How to Use

1. Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).
2. Press **Start** to activate your camera.
3. Point it to train it first, take at least 5 pictures for grass and not grass, then let it predict your next pictures 🌿

*Access to your webcam/camera is necesary for this project!
**Please wait a few seconds before taking pictures, to activate MobileNet.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- 🧠 **Pretrained Model**  
  Train the model on a larger dataset to improve accuracy and reduce the need for user input.

- 💾 **Persistent Training Data**  
  Store user-submitted training data locally (via localStorage or IndexedDB) to retain training across sessions.

- ⚡ **Improved Model**  
  Explore stronger models like ResNet or fine-tune MobileNet for better performance.

- 🖼️ **Image Upload**  
  Implement functionality for users to upload images and check if they’re grass or not.

- 🔌 **Offline Support**  
  Enable offline functionality with cached models and data.

- 🌐 **Crowdsourced Dataset**  
  Aggregate training data from multiple users to improve the classifier over time.
