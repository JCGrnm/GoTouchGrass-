# 🌿 **GoTouchGrass()** 🌿

Click here for the [Live Demo 🌱](https://jcgrnm.github.io/GoTouchGrass-/)


GoTouchGrass() is a fun little app that invites you to do one thing: go outside, snap a photo outside and find out if it’s grass or not! 

**Why GoTouchGrass()?**  
As devs, we spend a lot of time indoors.
GoTouchGrass() is a gentle reminder to literally go outside and touch some grass. 🌿
